Paris has been witnessing flood since its birth and this issue should be seriously discussed since the most important buildings in Paris including Museums, Notre-Dame, Eiffel and etc. are located on river side while the green and penetrative lands are not responsive to the big mass of flooding water. Moreover, Seine River bank is of concrete and making river bank more penetrative is a controversial issue as the concrete river bank is the main attraction of Paris. The flood water will be transferred to urban Lakes, Ponds and fountains inside the city through underground Channels. Lakes and ponds just have low level of water in non-flood situation and they work as performative landscapes, but during the flood they gradually start to be filled and the fountains work.
