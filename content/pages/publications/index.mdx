#### Biophilic design effects on individuals’ behaviors under review in journal of Environment and Behavior (2020)
###### Journal of Ecology & Environmental Sciences <small>(submitted)</small>

Minoo Assari, Shima Tajarloo

##### Abstract
This study investigates the evidence supporting the impacts of biophilic design on the psychological outcomes for participants within various settings. Designing by biophilic design principles and implementing biophilic elements in everyday spaces may potentially impact the psychological well-being of individuals. Prior research has suggested that the biophilic design can contribute to positive mental health outcomes. Reporting the most recent evidence may assist designers in making informed decisions. In this study, a literature review was conducted within six main scientific databases. A total number of 13 articles were included. Each psychological outcome affected by biophilic design principles were discussed in detail. The main psychological outcomes affected by biophilic elements are 1) stress, 2) anxiety, 3) mood, 4) perception, 5) fatigue, 6) restorative effects, 7) cognition, 8) social well-being, 9) nature relatedness and 10) behavior. Although several studies have provided a high level of evidence, other studies have lacked a robust research design.

## َAbstract
Urban landscape is the resultant of images of the city that are perceived by the audience and querying about the quality of the city is considered and updated urban management debate. Aesthetic interventions in the urban landscape are the most common measures to improve the quality and lighting contributes to its significance. On the one hand, bridge lighting which is one of the core elements of the urban landscape is considered an aesthetic intervention. On the other hand, they are important due to their visibility from distances at different speeds especially at night and in terms of structure. In Tehran, different approaches toward bridge lighting have led to some upgrade or degrade of the quality of the urban landscape.
Night landscape aesthetics of Tehran bridges are obtained through powerful sources of energy and there are distinct at night owing to the copious contrast to the dark context rather than having a vivid pattern; night landscape of Tehran bridges is not a coordinated procedure. In other words, these elements do not demonstrate a single entity, and they offer various personalities depending on the size or function each. Accordingly, aesthetic intervention in night landscape does not follow a standard credit and limited to single local intervention.
Landscape of bridges that are functionally or visually linked to transportation, have been taken into deeper consideration rather than pedestrian bridges by urban managers:
Pedestrian bridge with the lowest quantitative and qualitative lighting design are only limited to the minimum.
Lighting of roadway bridges has been maximum quantitatively which affects the aesthetics of the night.
Viewing bridges has similar lighting to roadway bridges in which the architecture and structure are determines of the lighting while the characteristics of the bridge should be the source of inspiration.
This paper aims to investigate Tehran's bridge night lighting with a goal to discuss and evaluate aesthetic intervention quality in the approach adopted for bridge lighting in terms of landscape.
