The yard and the deck have been constructed in the north of Iran in a residential complex in which each villa has a private yard. Instead of designing a pool in the middle of the yard that could make the most of the place, I decided to design a small pond, as the owner did not willing to use a big pool, rather they were so passionate about a yard with a lot of greenery and water to be at peace with the world there. There were two important orange trees, typical of that climate. In the first place I take them into consideration in my design, then the rest of the yard has been designed according to the existence of those trees. Other trees such as banana have been added to not only add more charm to the place, but be more useful for the resident who use that villa in their summer vacations. Some ivy plants also have been planted to make the walls as green as possible. As can be seen these ivies have been growing and make the place more and more amazing.
