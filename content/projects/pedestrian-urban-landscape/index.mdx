Transforming the Enghelab street, which is one of the most important streets in Tehran both culturally and politically that connects Azadi and Enghelab squares to each other, into a greenway is the main aim of the project. As this street has always been the intersection of poor and affluent as well as elite and ordinary people, and the scene of the most important events in Iran from the construction of the first cinema to peopleâ€™s demonstrations resulting in the revolution, its history should be definitely taken into consideration in the first place, so before any planning, a comprehensive analyze was done to understand what factor influenced this street the most. When considering different factors, it has been influenced the cultural one the most, and the second most important factor is the art. Adding a streetcar running on tramway track is the most important proposal to transform this street into a pedestrian way. As the major concept the stations of this tramway has a specific theme to tie different parts of the pedestrian way together. This theme is art and culture.

The first station is Music located in the Azadi square, which provides an outdoor stage for the spectators giving them an opportunity to enjoy music. This is followed by the Visual art station that has a strategic location, in front of the University of Tehran. This station has some functions including; photography, painting exhibitions, digital art exhibition as well as graffiti that give the university student a chance to express their feelings.
