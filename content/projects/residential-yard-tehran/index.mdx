The site project is located in the west of Tehran. It has been designed in order to use the maximum space to add greenery, so we decided to use green walls. Two important factors that have been taken into account for designing the green walls are both practicality and aesthetic. In a way that those wall have been designed to be a backdrop to the patio for nurturing the vegetables. The second aim of the project is to use recycled tins as container, as almost anything can be used as a container for plants such as tomato. By some color the can look much more decorative. There can be drainage holes in the bottom of container just by using a drill. Aesthetically I tried at all cost to design a yard, which gives residents a chance to be provided with lots of greenery and water both in the horizontal and vertical space.
