Proactive Landscape Architect with 4 years of experience in Landscape design in both big and small scales from designing neighborhood parks and highways to small back yards, that some of them have been constructed in some cities of Iran, as well as urban planning and water management with a great interest on sustainability and biophilic design including designing water sensitive urban design in Paris, suggestions for transforming a polluted and congested street in Tehran into a green pedestrian way, and designing a green bridge for creating a connection between two parks on the either side of a highway in Tehran.

Since two years ago I have started researching about various aspects of biophilic design both on human well-being and climate change, resulting in some papers, which are under review. Moreover, I have always had a high appreciation for visual arts of all kinds, so I have had many experiences doing Vitrail, Clay Carving, Mosaic Painting, Oil painting, and watercolor painting with some mosaic painting constructed projects, as well as holding some oil Painting and Watercolor Painting Exhibition In Tehran.
