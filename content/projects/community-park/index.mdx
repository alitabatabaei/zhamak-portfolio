The site project is located in a residential neighborhood in the west of Tehran, which is currently widely undeveloped. The main aim of the design is to create a neighborhood character through designing different kinds of public places, which not only provide residents with a number of leisure amenities, but also give them a sense of identity and belonging to their neighborhood. In the first place, the prospective park divides into three zones or colonies for three different age group, including children, youngsters, and elderlies. Design process continues to serve these age groups by providing them with the facilities they need. As for children, colour is incorporated into their colonies in order to add vitality to the place, and bring a rush of joy to their lives, more over some particular furniture is designed to make the park more intriguing for them. The children zone is located in the lower level to give them more security, while their parents supervise them from the upper level. With regard to the youngsters, some places are designed with tents to serve several useful purposes. Not only do they give young people an opportunity to gather together, but even can play a role as outdoor stages for performing theatre. When it comes to the elderly zone, apart from providing them with some public places to interact with each other, I decided to design some greenhouses for them. In this way they can be more physically active, nurturing different kinds of plants, which in turn enormously contributes to their mental wellbeing. 

What greatly stands out in this project is its methodology. Unlike other projects that design process starts from plan, it commences with some abstract pictures through collages and then by sketching some perspectives based on those collages we reach to the final plan. Actually it reaches from three dimensional to two dimensional design. It gives us the chance to not only be much more creative, but think about both the form and function of a place before designing its two-dimension plan.
