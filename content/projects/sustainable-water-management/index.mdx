**Model of Sustainable Water Management Infrastructure for Supplying water and Controlling Flood**

Water spots can be found in three scales in Australia: Reservoirs (Dams), Lakes and Ponds and they are connected by Rivers. Dams may intensify flood because of the great deal of water they reserve. The water gates must be opened for preventing from dam break during flood or they break as a result of pressure and both add to the water volume.

As reserving water in large scale wreak havoc on environment and results in unsustainability, inspiring from the concept of ponds rather than dams can be suggested as a sustainable method of supplying water and controlling flood. 

Keeping the balance of natural water cycle is of paramount importance for natural recourse preservation. Rivers for lands are like blood vessels for human body. Rivers balance should be kept in order to having a sustainable natural water and several factors including city size, quantity and size of man-made supplying facilities such as Dams and the construction growth are involved. 

Dams generate very big water spots which upset water structure balance. They act as cancerous tumors and disturb the functionality of natural environment.  What if we had connection of small ponds rather than Cotter Dam on Cotter river? If the spots be divided in smaller spots and be repeated in whole linear of the river, a more equivalent and sustainable change happens to the water structure. Furthermore, the volume of water running out of river can be controlled through control gates.
