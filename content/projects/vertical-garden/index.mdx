This design is an answer to one of the biggest challenges in landscape architecture in Tehran, which is landscape fragmentation. Construction of highways affect both the ecological balance in the environment and people’s perception of their natural environment. According to historical analyses, I understood before constructing the highways on the site chosen for this design, there were some hills in that area. So the main aim of the project is to compensate this fragmentation between two parks located in either side of the highway by designing a vertical landscape as a bridge, and developing the design to the periphery of the site reaching to those hills and parks. Not only can it help to make a connection visually, but also it can provide people with a landmark that is the embodiment of those historical hills, which were one of the most important parts of Tehran’s identity. 

The project site is located in Yadegar-Emam highway that has divided two part of historical hills as well as Pardisan park. Vertical garden in the first place was the major concept to design both for the green bridge and for the peripheral design. Creating a practical landscape along the highway for making people more physically active through walking and cycling has been the other concept. Since nowadays the overwhelming majority of people are greatly dependent on their single occupancy vehicles, and creating some infrastructures for cycling can give them a chance to leave their cars in their homes and make physical exercise parts of their lives. Moreover, traffic congestion has brought about air pollution, so the plants used in this design have been chosen to mitigate the air contamination caused by burning fossil fuels.
