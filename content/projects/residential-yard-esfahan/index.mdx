The site project is located in the south of Isfahan, in one of the posh areas named Mardavij. It has been designed in order to provide the residents with a place in which they can not only recharge their batteries, but also experience the calmness and serenity as a break from the constant noise of their hectic and frantic lifestyle. The main concept is to design based on the Japanese gardens, as its main principles are based on Taoist philosophies and Buddhist to inspire peaceful contemplation. Water as the major element is usually accompanied by other natural elements such as plants and rocks to create a tranquil environment where people are given a golden opportunity to be at peace with the world. so based on what the owners wanted in the first place a pond with a wooden bridge and a waterfall was designed. Then some plants that are the indication of Japanese gardens and can adapt to the Isfahanâ€™s climate have been added. The design has been done in a way that make the most of the place, as the other part of the yard should be allocated to the parking.
