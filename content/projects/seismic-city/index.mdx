Tehran is a seismic site and it should be retrofitted in different layers and scales based on seismic building codes. There are different systems that can be used for strengthening different types of buildings including small-scale residential buildings, large-scale official and commercial buildings, emergency centers and hospitals, governmental & security buildings as well as religious and cultural centers. The systems embrace from braces, dampers, base isolation, urban shelters and etc.

Earthquake is a vulnerability and a thread which can turn to a opportunity and a strong feature that can give meaning to city image. Retrofitting systems which have disturbed the city image for decades, can be developed and managed in a way to turn to aesthetic elements. 

Fictitious image of Tajrish telling earthquake story in Tehran: a deep fault passing north of Tehran and old non-retrofitted buildings eradication during earthquake, buildings that are strengthened by braces with Iranian patterns, walls with mountain stone layers and the floating shrine which is specifically strengthen through base isolation system.
